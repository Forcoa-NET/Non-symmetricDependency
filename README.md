# Non-Symmetric Structural Dependency

This repository contains implementation of non-symmetric structural similarity between pairs of nodes, which we refer to as dependency. This dependency can be used, thanks to non-symmetry, to accurately describe the prominent nodes in the zones which are responsible for large zone overlaps and the reasons why overlaps occur.

More background information and specific use case can be found in the original [article](https://appliednetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s41109-019-0192-6).
